			  Let's talk about Javascript and Browser. [-->Space] 
			  
			  Why do we care about Javascript? Why do we spend time on browser, css or any other client side programming topics? I remember just three four years ago, all I knew about JavaScript was GetElementByID and Hidden fields, how I debug anything was Alert.  So I didn't consider Javascript serious programming.   I suspect many developers share this mentality: You know, "We are .NET developers, we write serious server side code, in C#."  As for Javascript, it should be enough just to know how to find API references in jQuery docs; And if our app calls for a fancier UI, we just find a proper jQuery library (like lightbox), plug it in and that's it. [WRONG]

			Javascript is OLD, but it matters again after the introduction of Ajax and jQuery. With HTML5, it becomes essential in pushing the limit of what's possible on the Web.

            <section>
			 Well, Here's a timeline of when the important Web technologies were invented.   Javascript is OLD, but matters again after the introduction of Ajax and jQuery. And HTML5 gives another power shot.  A lot of Web games and Mobile app development activities are producing new  techonologies actively, such as like node.js(Serverside javascript that's it), Javascript MVC and unit testing....  HTML5 exposes more browser functions like Offline cache, in browser databases, localStorage(It saves state in Browser, for example remember which chapater you were reading in Google book and resume to the same point. It's like improved cookie.)  
			
			Job market has high demand for Javascript developers and pays close to .Net or Java developers, if not as high as.

			Even if you don't build games or mobile apps, I'm sure you've encountered more client side needs in today's web development. For example in Bingham.com project, We needed to tweak a Modal popup library way beyond basic setup (Javier can tell you all about that!). Myself needed to integrate Google Map with server side content with quite some customizations too.

			So, Javascript debugging and client side programming skills are essential these days.

The tools mainly are Browser Inspectors such as IE Developer Tool, and along the line of time saver and productivity, I'll also share some Browser tips.

            JsFiddle is an amazing tool that is accessible anywhere via a browser.  It gives you four panes. One for JavaScript, one for HTML, one for CSS and one to preview your code as it would run in a browser. This gives us a great way to test out and tweak code on the fly without having to switch back and forth between editor and browser, or upload code to a server to run. 

			The beauty of JSFiddle is quick prototyping: You rip off some script, html and css from an examples page, and tweak it and make it our own.
